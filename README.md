# Project Name
Housing priceCase Study

A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

The company wants to know:

1.Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house, and

2 How well those variables describe the price of a house.

3.Determine the optimal value of lambda for ridge and lasso regression.
